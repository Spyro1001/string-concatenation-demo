# String Concatenation Demo

 This demo class demonstrates the differences between different String concatenation strategies.
 
 * `LOOP_COUNT` determines how many concatenation iterations each type of concatenation goes through.
 * `TEST_COUNT` determines how many times the full set of tests is run.  Each `TEST_COUNT` iteration, the test strings are doubled in size.
